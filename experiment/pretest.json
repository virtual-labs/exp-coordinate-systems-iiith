                "a": "As distances from each of the three planes formed by the axes.",

                "a": "Incorrect. Homogeneous coordinates don't affect color in this context.",
                "b": "Correct! Changing the value of w scales the point's coordinates.",

                "a": "Incorrect. Homogenizing coordinates adds complexity for specific reasons.",
                "b": "Incorrect. Rendering efficiency is not the primary purpose of homogenization.",
                "c": "Correct! Homogenizing coordinates allows for expressing common operations, such as translation, as a linear product.",
