## Interactive Simulation Procedure

### Add a Shape:

1. **Click Add Shape:**
   - Click on the **Add Shape** button.
   
2. **Select Shape Coordinates:**
   - Specify the coordinates for the shape.
   
3. **Submit Shape:**
   - Click **Add** to add the specified shape to the simulation.

### Select and Edit Shape:

1. **Click Select Shape:**
   - Use the **Select Shape** option to pick a shape for modification within the simulation.
   
2. **Edit Shape:**
   - Click **Edit Shape** to adjust the properties or position of the selected shape.

### Observing Shape in Coordinate System:

This experiment visually demonstrates how shapes are represented within a coordinate system. By adding shapes and adjusting their positions or properties, the simulation illustrates how different coordinates affect the appearance and positioning of shapes. This exploration helps in understanding how coordinates define the spatial arrangement and visual representation of objects in graphical simulations.
