Two dimensional points are represented as perpendicular distance from orthogonal axes, usually called X and Y. So (2,3) represents a point 2 units from the y-axis and 3 units from the x-axis. If the co-ordinate axes are non-orthogonal, the point represents distances taken parallel to the axes.  

Three dimensional points are represented as distances from each of the three planes formed by the axes. So (2,3,4) represents a point 2 units from YZ-plane, 3 units from XZ-plane and 4 units from XY-plane.  

Coordinates can be 'homogenized' by adding an extra value to the tuple. In 3 dimensions, points are represented as (x,y,z,w) which is equivalent to (x/w, y/w, z/w) in ordinary co-ordinates. This is a convenient representation used heavily in computer graphics as it allows writing the common operations such as translation as a linear product.
