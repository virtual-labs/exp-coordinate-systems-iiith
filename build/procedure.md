### Experiment Procedure

1. **Understanding Point Representation:**
   - Navigate to `Instance -> Shape -> Vertices` and locate the node corresponding to the point.
   - Edit the coordinates of the point to observe how it is displayed.

2. **Modifying Coordinate System:**
   - Navigate to `Instance -> Coordinate System` and adjust the origin and axis directions.
   - Observe how the point is redrawn using the modified coordinate system.
   - Take note of the absolute coordinates displayed.

3. **Homogeneous Coordinates:**
   - Points shown within '[' and ']' use homogeneous coordinates.
   - Modify the fourth component (w) and observe how it scales the point's coordinates.

4. **Absolute vs. Relative Coordinates:**
   - Edit the absolute coordinates of the point and observe how relative coordinates are calculated with respect to the coordinate system.

5. **Switch to 3D:**
   - Under the `Display` tab, switch to 3D view.
   - Perform all previous actions in 3D.
   - Use right mouse button drag to rotate the view and the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.

**Note:** This experiment focuses on understanding the representation of points in 2D and 3D space using both orthogonal and non-orthogonal coordinate systems in the context of computer graphics.
